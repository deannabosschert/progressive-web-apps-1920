# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020

In this course we will convert the client side web application previously made at the OBA (OR during WAFS) into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately we are going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.  

## Learning goals
- _You understand the difference between client side and server side rendering and you can apply server side rendering
in your application_
- _You understand how a Service Worker works and you can implement it in your application._
- _You understand how the critical render path works and how you can optimize it for a better runtime and / or perceived performance._
